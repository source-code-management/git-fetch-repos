${gitlab_api}     --> 'this is for GitLab repos list'
${repo_date}      --> 'use this variable to filter the results by date. the date format is YYYY-MM-DD, you can insert it all or even a part, eg. 2022 or 2022-05. if you don`t want any filter you can put "date" as value'
${excluded_group} --> 'use it to exclude one organization/group from the list. if you don`t want any filter you must put a random word as value (eg. "pippo")'
${base_dir}       --> 'specify where you want all the cloned repos'
${branch}         --> 'all these 3 variables must be defined. if you don`t know or don`t have a branch priority, you can put a random word as a value to be able to clone the default branch (eg. "pippo")'
